If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

According to my own understanding of "Audio Auras", it specifies whether the user listens to positive music or not depending on how high the values of energy, valence and danceability.
Example:
    High Energy means more positive
    High Valence means more positive
    High Danceability more positive
    Low Energy means more negative
    Low Valence means more negative
    Low Danceability more negative

But, that doesn't mean that this truly indicates the mood of the listener, our sample is only 100 songs which is not enough.
