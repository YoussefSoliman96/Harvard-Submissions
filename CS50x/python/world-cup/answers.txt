Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, only teams with the highest rating seemed to appear in the winners list, when the sample size increased, every other team appeared in the list.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 1000 rounds.
