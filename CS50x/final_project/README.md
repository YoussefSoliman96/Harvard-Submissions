# Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to have something that displays my package to the user's when I'm done with learning, as when I finish all the courses and start doing my own projects, I should havs something like that portfolio so I can easily display my projects on to the recruiters and provide easy access to me and all my links.
It also shows my styling skills as it's not easy to display good views only using CSS without using any platforms

# Page Main Sections:

This File contains resizing styles to fit the page to whatever screen it's being shown on:

- Sections had to be adjusted manually for smaller screen sizes so they wouldn't be cut off
